Pomodoro Timer
==============

Overview
--------
This repository seeks to make a packaged .exe pomodoro timer that can run on
the windows machine. 

We will be building the GUI with pysimple gui, using the default install for to
incorporate the tkinter module and interface.

This will be a learning project, along with the first time I've tried to
package an exe.

Design
------

The Design pattern will be simple at first, maybe evolving in the future. The
basics should include:

1. Start Stop buttons
2. Timer
3. 20 Minute intervals, x 3
4. 5/10 Minute interval, x 1
5. Print time remaining / elapsed time


This can become a complex project for me at this point in time, so I want to
take it slow and try to keep good documentation and notes over the project.
